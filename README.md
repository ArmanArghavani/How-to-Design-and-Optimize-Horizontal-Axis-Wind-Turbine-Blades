# How-to-Design-and-Optimize-Horizontal-Axis-Wind-Turbine-Blades
 This guide offers an open-source method for designing, analyzing, and optimizing small horizontal-axis wind turbine blades. The reference testing environment is a 3 ft by 3 ft collegiate wind tunnel, which offers a controlled and repeatable flow field suitable for evaluating small-scale rotors.
